## MacOS Usage
### Requirements

- OpenAI API Key
Because JARVIS and the ChatGPT app is not on the MacOS App Store, JARVIS has been adapted to a Shortcut that requires an OpenAI API key.

First, add the shortcut to your Mac [here](https://).

After that, to use JARVIS simply activate Siri on your Mac and say "Hey Jarvis", and JARVIS will respond with "Hello, how can I assist you today?", or whatever you set it to say. Customizing the shortcut is pretty self explanatory. It's that easy.
## iOS Usage
### Requirements
- Shortcuts App
- ChatGPT iOS App
- iOS 15+
